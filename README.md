# GroupProject_Victor_and_GuillermoRuizSenso

Project carried out by Victor Ruiz Senso(70933) and Guillermo Ruiz Senso(71235)

The project consists of the development of a login and registration, using the Firebase database.
Once you login, the app will start counting your steps and once you reach 1000 steps, your steps will be registered in the database along with your data.

We did not have time to produce the table view with the ranking of the different users, but we have done our best and to the best of our knowledge. 
We tried to do our best and searched the internet to find out how to do it, but we had a lot of problems with Firebase and in the end we didn't have time to finish it.

As we both do it together and live in the same house, we have done the project from a single computer, so there are no differentiated parts of what each one has done, 
but we have done more or less half each one. (We realised that we had to upload it late, when we already had all the code in a single computer).
